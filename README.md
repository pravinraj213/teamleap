# TeamLeap 🚀  
**Find your people. Build your future.**  
A solo-founder student product to help college students find trustworthy teammates for hackathons, projects, and competitions — built with AI as a co-pilot.

## 👋 About

Hi, I’m **Pravinraj**, an engineering student and solo founder.  
I know what it feels like when you want to build something great but struggle to find the right people.  
So I started building **TeamLeap** — a simple, honest platform to make team-building easier for students like me.

---

## 🎯 Why I Built It

- ✅ It’s hard to find reliable teammates for hackathons or group projects.
- 🔍 Most students choose teammates randomly — not based on goals or working style.
- 🤝 There’s no real platform built for **student compatibility**, not just technical skills.
- 🧠 I’m using AI (like ChatGPT + Perplexity) to research, code, and design everything with care.

## 💡 The Idea

> Not just "form a team."  
> But **build a trusted crew you can grow with.**

TeamLeap helps you find teammates not only by skills, but also by your working preferences, time commitment, and mindset — the stuff that really matters.

## 🧠 Philosophy
